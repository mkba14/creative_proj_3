Vue Creative Project

Due Oct 25 by 11:59pm Points 100 Submitting a website url

For this project, you will create a website that uses Vue for the front end and accesses a REST service. This website can be for anything you want, but should not be similar to the Vue apps we have already built so far. You must create your own original work, dont just duplicate a class assignment.




Requirements
This is a creative project, so you are welcome to build what you would like. The basic requirements are:

  The site uses Vue
  The site accesses a REST service
  The site contains a footer that links to your public GitHub repository
  The GitHub repository should be in your own GitHub account.




Submission
You must submit to canvas the URL to your webpage (and make sure it is available from the due time until you have a grade), the URL to your github repository for this project, and a brief description about your creative usage of the technology(ies) required. This could include things you learned, issues you ran into (and overcame), or anything else you want to tell the TAs about your project. Make sure that your submitted URLs turn into links!

You must also put your project URL on the spreadsheet  (Find the right tab on the bottom) for demo day.




Rubric for Grading
We will grade your projects based on:

  you used Vue for the entire site
  You access a REST service
  how well you follow web design principles: spacing, typography, color, consistency, 
    and responsive design.
  TAs will assign scores in these ranges:

  90-100: Excellent use of Vue, clearly follows web design principles, 
        uses a REST service
  80-90: Uses Vue, good effort was made, but needs work to more clearly present 
        the data or follow web design principles
  70-80: Fulfills the minimum requirement of using Vue, but does not make a 
        strong effort to use it well or follow web design principles
